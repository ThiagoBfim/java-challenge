# Challenge with Java BE

This is a simple project with a challenge for Backend developers.

## In this project you will learn:

* Consuming API (Feign)
* Creating API REST (Spring Web)
* Create a database (Spring Data)
* Create a CircuitBreak & RateLimiter (Resilience4J)
* Different Roles & JWT (Spring Security)
* JUnit, Mockito, MockMvc
* H2/Postgres
* Cache with Hazelcast
* Swagger
* Sonar
* CI/CD
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Deploy in Cloud

## Tasks:

### LVL 1 

**Goals:** 
* Create the project
* Create the database using H2
* Create the user entity, and Roles
* Include JWT authentication
* Create the login/registration/upgrade-permissions endpoints

**Expected time:** 16 | 8 | 4 hours

#### Create your project

- [ ] Create the database using [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html). You should include the user table, the user can have multiple roles.
- [ ] Create two roles ADMIN, USER
- [ ] Create an endpoint to create a user (register). The user should have a username and a password, be careful when saving the user password, and the roles.

#### Create the authentication for your API

- [ ] Create an endpoint to return the JWT (5 minutes of timeout), receive the username and password
- [ ] Create the authentication using JWT
- [ ] Create an endpoint to update the permission to this user to ADMIN and/or USER role. This API could be called just by the ADMIN user, see @Secured and Roles in Spring Security.

### LVL 2

**Expected time:** 16 | 9 | 5 hours

#### Upgrade your API REST

- [ ] Create an endpoint to consume an API from TBMD to retrieve all the movies [([https://imdb-api.com/](https://developer.marvel.com/)) ](https://developer.themoviedb.org/)and populate your database (you can use WebClient or Feign to consume the API). This API could be called just by the ADMIN user, see @Secured and Roles in Spring Security.
- [ ] Create an endpoint to list all the movies.
- [ ] Create an endpoint to include a movie to the user (favorite list)
- [ ] Create an endpoint to exclude the movie from the favorite list
- [ ] Each time the user includes the movie in the favorite list add one "star" to the movie
- [ ] Create an endpoint to list the top 10 movies, the movies with more stars.
- [ ] Create an endpoint to list the favorite movies per user.
- [ ] Don't forget to include Swagger/OpenAPI, and the test.

### LVL 3

**Expected time:** 18 | 11 | 7 hours

#### Include Hazelcast, design pattern, Resilience4J

- [ ] Include this rank top movies in the cache (Hazelcast), and get from it using RateLimiter (https://resilience4j.readme.io/docs/ratelimiter) as fallback.
- [ ] Find another API to get Movies, and update the first endpoint to use the template method design pattern to be able to get the movies from both APIs. Use a CircuitBreak for that. If you have any problem with one API you should get it from the other API as a fallback. (You can try changing the API Key)
- [ ] Create a new endpoint to send a random movie to the user.
This endpoint should do this: find another user who likes the same movies as the current user and upload a random movie from that favorites list.
If this condition does not exist, just send a random movie.

### LVL 4

**Expected time:** 21 | 14 | 8 hours

#### Part 1 - Docker, Kubernetes

- [ ] Run your application using Docker, create a docker file.
- [ ] Create the files to deploy the application using kubernetes.
- [ ] Include the probes from actuator in your deployment.yaml
- [ ] Deploy your application in local environment using Kubernetes.


**Expected time:** 27 | 17 | 7 hours

#### Part 2 - Deploy in the cloud, Openshift

### LVL 5

#### Pipeline, CI/CD, Sonar

- [ ] Include SonarCloud in your project, make sure the coverage is above 70% and you don't have a loud code smell.
- [ ] Include a pipeline, you can use gitHub Actions, or Travis CI, use what you prefer. Your CI pipeline should include [build, test, sonar]
- [ ] Include also CD in your pipeline, it should be able to deploy in the Cloud.
